# Kyphosis Dataset Analysis and Machine Learning Models

This project analyzes the Kyphosis dataset and demonstrates the use of Decision Tree and Random Forest machine learning models for classification tasks. Kyphosis is a spinal condition, and this dataset contains information about whether a patient developed kyphosis following surgery. The goal is to build predictive models to identify whether a patient is likely to develop kyphosis after surgery based on certain features.

## Introduction

The Kyphosis dataset is widely used in the field of machine learning and healthcare. It contains the following columns:

- Age: The age of the patient.
- Number: The number of vertebrae involved in the operation.
- Start: The topmost vertebrae that was operated on.
- Kyphosis: A binary column indicating whether kyphosis was present after the operation (1 for yes, 0 for no).

## Usage

This section provides a brief overview of how to use the project:

1. **Data Preparation**: The dataset should be preprocessed, which may include handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

2. **Decision Tree Model**:
   - A Decision Tree classifier is used to predict the presence or absence of kyphosis.
   - The model can be trained on the training dataset.
   - Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) on the test dataset.
   - Optionally, visualize the Decision Tree to gain insights into how the model makes decisions.

3. **Random Forest Model**:
   - A Random Forest classifier is employed to predict kyphosis.
   - Train the Random Forest model using the training data.
   - Evaluate the model's performance with the same metrics used for the Decision Tree.
   - Explore feature importance to understand which features contribute most to the predictions.
